//QUESTION N0.3

/* 
   ANS 1: .java is the extension used for creating the java files in the computer
   systems. Java programs that we write in java language is always saved as filename.java
   Then we use java compiler to compile the saved file and the copiler takes the file
   with .java extension and after that return us with the .class extension file.
   So, .class is file that is created after the compiliation which is executeable file
   then we can esily run that file in our system and it shows the output.
   
   
   
   ANS 2: No Java is not a complete OOP's programming language because there are primitive 
   data types in it which are not same as objects so we have to use wrapper classes for it 
   thats why java is not completely OOP's programming language.
  
   
   
   
   ANS 3: Example of (NR-WA)
        
		public void sum(int a, int b){
			int c = a + b;
			
		} 
		
		This function have return type void which means no return value and it takes two 
		arguments that are a,b.
   


*/

//QUESTION NO.5 

/*
  Wraper Classes: These are used to converts the primitive data types into the objects.
  For example, we have int a, primitive
             and if we create new
			 int a;
			 Integer i2 = a;
 so in this way we can use it to convert it.
